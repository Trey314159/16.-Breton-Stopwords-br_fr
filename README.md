# Stopwordsbr-fr-breton
**Description

- The most comprehensive collection of stopwords for the breton language.
- You will find here a draft list of stopwords for Breton.

**An ISO 639 cod problem

- The ISO 639 Code for Brazilian "pt-BR" is very similar to the breton one "br" so sometimes that causes some mistakes.

- As an exemple of that, the other stopwords list you will find here: https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-br

- This was at the beginning of everything containing a list of Stopwords for the Brazilian Language, whereas the readme file was mentionning that it was for the Breton language.

- We (a friend of mine https://github.com/tornoz and I) have notified "Gene Diaz" that it was a mistacke with datas contained, so he had fixed it :D.

- We have decided to create another correct list of stopwords for the Breton Language, while we were waiting him to correct the mistacke. We have worked hard on this list of stopwords, and we are proud of our work.

-Thanks a lot to @Tornoz for his correction and advices.

**A few conventions

- Letters between {} are letters which can mutate into other ones, i.e:
- {g}ran means in particular cases the 'g' mutates, so it desappear.
-  When there is several possibility of mutations it has been chosen to show all the possibilities, until now, but it could change.

**This work is based on

- The list of breton stopwords has been done with help of the french and english lists of stopwords and also all this websites:
