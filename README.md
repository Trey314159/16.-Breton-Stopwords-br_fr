# Stopwordsbr-fr-breton
The most comprehensive collection of stopwords for the breton language.

You will find out here a draft list of stopwords for Breton.


The other stopwords list you will find here: https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-br
is in fact for the Brazilian Language, and here it will be only for the Breton Language.

We have already notified "Gene Diaz" that it was a mistake with the ISO Code, and since we don't have any answer from him.
The ISO Code for Brazilian "br" is very similar to the breton one "br_fr" so sometimes that causes some mistakes.

So, I have prefered to create another correct list of stopwords for the Breton Language.

A friend of mine https://github.com/tornoz and I, have worked hard on this list of stopwords.
Thanks a lot to him for his correction and advices.

I hope We will have an answer from Gene Diaz shortly :)

For you to know:
Letters between "" aren't to be taken into account.
The list of breton stopwords has been done with help of the french and english lists of stopwords and also all this websites:
