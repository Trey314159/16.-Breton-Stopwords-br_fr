# Stopwordsbr-fr-breton
The most comprehensive collection of stopwords for the breton language.

You will find here a draft list of stopwords for Breton.

The ISO 639 Code for Brazilian "pt-BR" is very similar to the breton one "br" so sometimes that causes some mistakes.

As an exemple of that, the other stopwords list you will find here:

https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-br

was at the beginning of everything containing a list of Stopwords for the Brazilian Language, whereas the readme file was mentionning that it was for the Breton language.

We (a friend of mine and I) have notified "Gene Diaz" that it was a mistake with the ISO Code, so he had fixed it :D.

So, I have prefered to create another correct list of stopwords for the Breton Language, while we were waiting him to correct the mistacke.

A friend of mine https://github.com/tornoz and I, have worked hard on this list of stopwords.

Thanks a lot to him for his correction and advices.

For you to know:

Letters between "" aren't to be taken into account.

The list of breton stopwords has been done with help of the french and english lists of stopwords and also all this websites:
