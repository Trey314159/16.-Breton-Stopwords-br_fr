# Stopwordsbr-fr-breton
You will find out here a draft list of stopwords for Breton.
The most comprehensive collection of stopwords for the breton language.
The other stopwords list you will find here: https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-br
is in fact for the Brazilian Language, and here it will be only for the Breton Language.
We have already notified "Gene Diaz" that it was a mistake with the ISO Code, and since we don't have any answer from him.
The ISO Code for Brazilian "br" is very similar to the breton one "br_fr" so sometimes that causes some mistakes.
I have prefered to create another correct list of stopwords for the Breton Language.

A friend of mine https://github.com/tornoz and I, have worked hard on this list of stopwords.
Thanks a lot to him for his correction and advices.
I hope We will have an answer from Gene Diaz shortly :)
